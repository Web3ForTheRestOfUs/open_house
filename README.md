## Design Story

### The Problem

Meet Sarah, a young professional who just accepted a job offer in a new city. Like millions of others, she needs to find a place to live. The traditional route seems simple: contact real estate agents, schedule viewings, and find a home. But Sarah's experience, like many others, quickly becomes frustrating:

- She pays multiple inspection fees, often for properties that don't match her needs
- Agents show her properties in areas they prefer, not where she wants to live
- Hidden fees keep piling up: agency fees, agreement fees, caution fees
- The total cost becomes almost half her annual rent
- She can't get honest reviews about the properties or neighborhoods

### The Vision

Imagine instead a world where Sarah opens the OpenHouse dApp:

1. She browses a curated list of properties, each with high-quality photos and detailed information
2. Community members (we call them "Scouts") have documented these properties, earning tokens for their contributions
3. Each listing has anonymous, verified reviews from previous viewers and tenants
4. Virtual tours and detailed neighborhood information help her narrow down choices
5. When she finds a property she likes, she pays a small fee to get the location and contact details
6. After viewing, she contributes her own review, earning tokens and helping others

### The Revolution

OpenHouse isn't just another rental platform â€“ it's a community-driven ecosystem that:
- Eliminates unnecessary middlemen and their excessive fees
- Rewards community members for contributing valuable information
- Creates transparency through anonymous, verified reviews
- Builds trust through blockchain verification
- Reduces rental costs for tenants
- Creates new earning opportunities for community members
