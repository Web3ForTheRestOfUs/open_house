#### 7.1 Smart Contract Testing
1. **Unit Tests**
   ```javascript
   describe("PropertyRegistry", () => {
     it("should register new property")
     it("should distribute rewards correctly")
     it("should handle location reveals")
     it("should process review submissions")
   })

   describe("TokenManagement", () => {
     it("should calculate rewards accurately")
     it("should handle token distributions")
     it("should manage review incentives")
   })
   ```

2. **Integration Tests**
   - End-to-end property listing flow
   - Token distribution scenarios
   - Review system integration
   - Location reveal mechanism

#### 7.2 Frontend Testing
1. **Component Testing**
   ```javascript
   describe("PropertyCard", () => {
     it("displays property information correctly")
     it("handles image loading")
     it("processes user interactions")
   })

   describe("SearchFilter", () => {
     it("applies filters correctly")
     it("updates results in real-time")
   })
   ```
